        <p>The target audience for this website are those who are looking to invest in the local area, either by joining this group of businesses, or by becoming a customer of them.</p>
        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>A young adult male who achieved the highest public education. He has been a blacksmith apprentice, but is looking to decide where to set down for their journeyman life.
